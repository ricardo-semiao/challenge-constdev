# Constellation Dev Challenge 2022 - Team GVCode

Welcome! This is the repository for the [GVCode](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fgvcode/)'s team entry to the Constellation Dev Challenge 2022. The team was comprised of me (Ricardo Semi√£o), [Victor Dutra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorlaubedutra/), and [Bruno Erlong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-ting-erlong-a12479224/).

Constellation Asset Management is known by their valuation challenge, and the Dev Challenge was their first on the data science field. The goal was to predict the Brazilian stock market flow, and was made in three parts: (i) initial model submition on kaggle, (ii) report explaining the model and the process of creating it, and (iii) in person presentation with the three best groups, at the firm's HQ.

The team got the best prediction error, and the second place overall.
